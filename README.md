# Image Processing Program in C

This project is an image processing program written in C. It reads a PPM (P6) image file, applies various filters (grayscale, mean filter, negative), and writes the processed image back to a file. The program ensures efficient memory management and handles errors gracefully.

## Features

- **Grayscale Conversion**: Converts the image to grayscale by averaging the RGB values.
- **Mean Filter**: Applies a mean filter to smooth the image.
- **Negative Conversion**: Converts the image to its negative by inverting the RGB values.
- **PPM Image Support**: Reads and writes PPM (P6) format images.

**Follow the prompts**:

    - Enter the input filename.
    - Enter the output filename.
    - Choose the filter to apply: `P` for Grayscale, `M` for Mean Filter, `N` for Negative.
